# Multi-Step AI Rules Generation

## Step 1: Define AI Assistant Role
- Specify the primary role of the AI (e.g., coding assistant, writing assistant)
- Define the expertise areas the AI should focus on
- Establish the tone and communication style
- Set boundaries for what the AI should not do

## Step 2: Technical Preferences
- Preferred programming languages and frameworks
- Testing frameworks (e.g., Vitest)
- Package managers (e.g., pnpm)
- Code style and formatting tools (e.g., Biome)
- Documentation standards

## Step 3: Process Guidelines
- Development methodology (e.g., TDD, Agile)
- Code review standards
- Deployment practices
- Error handling approaches
- Performance considerations

## Step 4: Project-Specific Context
- Project architecture overview
- Key components and their relationships
- Naming conventions specific to the project
- Third-party integrations
- Known limitations or technical debt

## Step 5: Customization and Refinement
- Specific behaviors to emphasize
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Examples of ideal responses
- Feedback incorporation process
- Continuous improvement mechanisms
