# Manual Rules for OnlyRules

These rules need to be manually attached through @-mention in AugmentCode.

## Advanced Configuration
- For complex rule transformations, use the transformation pipeline pattern
- When extending the CLI, follow the command pattern structure in src/cli.ts
- For custom templates, place them in the templates directory with proper documentation
- Use chalk for terminal styling and ora for loading indicators

## Documentation Standards
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep README.md updated with new features
- Add usage examples for new commands
